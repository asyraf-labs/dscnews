# HackerNews Clone ðŸ”¥

I'm not a fan of `Hackernews`, but I love how the structure of the website. Hackernews is one of the awesome link aggregator website out there. Same like Reddit. The feature of Hackernews that I love is ;

âœ…  nested comments

âœ…  simple form ðŸ˜‚

âœ…  the algo for the points system

âœ…  the upvote stuff ðŸ¤˜

### See the demo [live app !!!](https://dscnews.herokuapp.com/)

I also write an awesoem blog post talking about the process of building this project and what I've learned along the process.
